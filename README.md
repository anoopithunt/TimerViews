TimerView is a simple SwiftUI view that displays a countdown timer for a given end date.
# Usage
To use TimerView in your SwiftUI app, follow these steps:

1. Copy the TimerView struct into your Xcode project.
2. In your SwiftUI view, use TimerView as a child view and pass the end date as a string:




        struct ContentView: View {
		
          		 var body: some View {
    
          			 TimerView(endDateText: "21-12-2027")
            
					  }
         
	  		 }


3. Run your app and you should see a countdown timer displayed on the screen.
